# Artist Finder  
> It is a search engine of three top artists in a given country and their albums. The API I used is called Musixmatch.

## General info
The goal of the project was to create a smoothly working application on devices with different resolutions using an external api.

## Technologies used
* ES6 - MVC pattern, the concept of application state (I used this concept to have everything accessible in one module instead of many variables in different places), also some features from ES Next (like async/await)
* NPM, Babel, Webpack
* SASS

## To run: 
www.testingpage.pl

## Status
Project is:  _finished_. Design and implementation made by me from scratch.
